                                          ##Overview of Project
We used UFO sightings data stored in a JavaScript array; to display as a table. We created a filter for each data column to filter out data as we desired, thus making it dynamic. To view our page, we used HTML to show data. This project aims to provide multiple search criteria at the same to display desired data.

                                                ##Results

When we first visit the webpage, we see an article written by Dana. Scrolling down the page on the right, we have displayed all the UFO sightings data. On the left side, we have the search option. We can filter the page using date, city, state, country, or shape. Search can be done by either inputting one or all the criteria on the search bars. 

When we use just one search criteria:

When we use multiple search criteria:

When we want to go back to the web page's original state, we can either clear out all the search bars or refresh the page.

                                                   ##Summary

Drawback:

•	One drawback this webpage has is that there is no button for the search bar. We should wait for the user to finish all the search criteria they want to put in and then hit the search button instead of automatically updating every time we hit enter on our keyboard. This makes the searching experience confusing since it updates every time we write a new keyword. Also, when we Refresh the page, it doesn't refresh the search bar to its initial stage. input from the user is still there.

Recommendation for further development :

•	Clear search criteria: There must be clear search criteria button, instead of refreshing the page or clearing out search criteria. Add another button to clear the search bars. 

•	Drop-down menu: we should have a drop-down menu to improve the searching. Especially the drop-down menu for the state. This way, users can pick a form instead of guessing and typing their search criteria.
