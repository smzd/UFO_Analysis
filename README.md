                                                     ##Overview of Project
We used UFO sightings data stored in a JavaScript array; to display as a table. We created a filter for each data column to filter out data as we desired, thus making it dynamic. To view our page, we used HTML to show data. This project aims to provide multiple search criteria at the same to display desired data.

                                                           ##Results

When we first visit the webpage, we see all an article by Dana. Scrolling down the page on the right side, we have all the UFO sightings data displayed. On the left side, we have the search option. We can filter the page using date, city, state, country, or shape. Search can be done by either inputting one or all the criteria on the search bars. 

When we use just one or date criteria:

When we use multiple search criteria:

When we want to go back to the web page's original state, we can either clear out all the search bars or refresh the page.

                                                           ##Summary

Drawback:

• One drawback this webpage has is that there is no button for the search bar. We should wait for the user to finish all the search criteria they want to put in and then hit the search button instead of automatically updating every time we hit enter on our keyboard. This makes the whole searching experience confusing since it updates every time we write a new keyword.

Recommendation for further development:

•	Clear search criteria: There must be clear search criteria instead of refreshing the page or clearing out search criteria. Add another button to clear the search bars. 

•	Drop-down menu: we should have a drop-down menu to improve the searching. Significantly drop down menu on the state. This way, users can pick a form instead of guessing and then type their desired search criteria.
